# Summary
Azure Functions that create Events, Metrics, and Exceptions in Azure Application Insights.  These were created because there are no Azure Application Insights REST APIs or Power Platform connectors to perform these operations and we wanted to log Power Apps and Flow errors and application telemetry to Application Insights.

# Uses
Invoke from anything that can invoke an Azure Function including Power Apps and Flows.

# See them in action
Watch these videos to see how to use these Azure Functions inside Power Apps and Flows.
